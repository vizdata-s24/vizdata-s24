Marathon times of runners in the Men and Women divisions of the New York City Marathon between 1970 and 2020 can be found in the nyc_marathon dataset in the openintro package (which is already installed for you). You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation with ?nyc_marathon and you can also find this information here.\na. Create a histogram and a box plot of the distribution of marathon times of all runners in the dataset. What features of the distribution are apparent in the histogram and not the box plot? What features are apparent in the box plot but not in the histogram?\nb. Create a side-by-side box plots of marathon times for men and women. Use different colors for the each of the box plots – do not use the default colors, but instead manually define them (you can choose any two colors you want). Based on the plots you made, compare the distribution of marathon times for men and women.\nc. What information in the above plot is redundant? Redo the plot avoiding this redundancy. How does this update change the data-to-ink ratio?\nd. Visualize the marathon times of men and women over the years. As is usual with time series plot, year should go on the x-axis. Use different colors and shapes to represent the times for men and women. Make sure your colors match those in the previous part.

Write a few sentences describing your approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome tips:\n\nI didn’t give you a dataset to plot, you’ll need to make one. Use tibble() or tribble() to do that again. It really doesn’t matter what you choose to include in that dataset as long as you achieve the final look.\nThe red used in the plot is the “Target red”, you can google and find out what that is. Don’t forget to cite your source for this too!\nThe registered trademark symbol (R in a circle) can be a bit trickier to figure out. There is a only a very small number of points associated with that component of the plot. So think of it as a “stretch goal” and work on figuring out the rest of the plot first.\nThe aspect ratio of of your plot in your Quarto document is just as important as the plot. Once you figure out the code to make the plot, knit your document to make sure it looks good in the output of your Quarto document.\nThere are many ways you can do this, feel free to discuss with classmates but fight the urge to adopt their approach. Instead, try to come up with your unique one.",

    "text": "Question 5\nNapoleon’s march.\nThe instructions for this exercise are simple: recreate Napoleon’s march plot by Charles John Minard in ggplot2. The data is provided as a list, saved as napoleon.rds in the data folder of your repo. Read it in using read_rds(). This object has three elements: cities, temperatures, and troops. Each of these is a data frame, and the three of them combined contain all of the data you need to recreate the visualization. Your goal isn’t to create an exact replica of the original plot, but to get as close to it as you can using code you understand and can describe articulately in your response. I’ll be the first to say that if you google “Napoleon’s march in ggplot2”, you’ll find a bunch of blog posts, tutorials, etc. that walk you through how to recreate this visualization with ggplot2. So you might be thinking, “why am I being asked to copy something off the internet for my homework?” Well, this is an exercise in (1) working with web resources and citing them properly, (2) understanding someone else’s ggplot2 code and reproducing their work, (3) describing what that code does in your own words, and finally (4) putting some final touches to make the final product your own. Some more guidelines below:\n\nYou should make sure your response properly cites all of the resources you use. I’m defining “use” to include “browse, read, get inspired by, or directly borrow snippets of code from”. You don’t need to worry about formal citations, it’s okay to make a list with links to your resources and provide a brief summary of how you used each one.\nFor this exercise, you’re asked to describe what your code does. If you write the code, it should be straightforward for you to describe it. If you borrow any code from outside resources, you need to understand what that code does, and describe it, in your own words. (This is important, you’re allowed to use found code, but you are not allowed to copy someone’s blog post or tutorial as your description of their code.)\nFinally, you should personalize the visualization with your own touch. You can do this in a myriad of ways, e.g., change colors, annotations, labels, etc. This change should be made to make the plot more like the original in some way. You need to explicitly call out what change you made and why you made it.",

Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard, students agree:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\nI will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive community\nIt is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive. Please update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: vizdata.org.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Sakai, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

Students who attend at least 80% of the lectures and participate regularly during lecture will receive full credit for this portion of their grade. Participation in labs as well as on Slack will also count towards this component.\nReading quizzes, due every other week (roughly), completed individually. Lowest quiz score is dropped.\nReading quizzes will be linked from the course schedule. They always cover reading that is due since the previous quiz and up to and including the deadline for the given quiz. They’re due by 10 am ET (beginning of class) on the indicated day on the course schedule.\nHomework assignments, due every other week (roughly), completed individually. Lowest homework assignment score is dropped.\nHomework assignments are due by 5 pm ET on the indicated day on the course schedule.\nProjects (2), mid-semester and end of semester, completed in teams.\n\nProject 1: Teams will be given a dataset (or a set of datasets to choose from) to visualize. Project 1 is worth 15% of the course grade.\nProject 2: Teams will choose the focus of their own project. One requirement is that you need to do something new. Project 2 is worth 25% of the course grade.\n\nThe deliverables for each project will include a data visualization, a write up of the process and findings, and a presentation. For the second project, you will be encouraged to think beyond a traditional two-dimensional data visualization (e.g. interactive web apps/dashboards, data art, generative art, physical/tangible visualizations, ggplot2 extensions, etc.).\nEach project will have a peer review component to provide at least one round of feedback during the process of development. Teams will provide periodic peer feedback to their teammates while working on the projects as well as upon completion. The scores from the peer evaluations, along with individual contributions tracked by commits on GitHub, will be used to ensure that each student has contributed to the teamwork.\nAll team members must take part in the presentation. Presentations can be given in person in class, or via Zoom if the team prefers. My preference is that the team stick to one method of delivery (all presenters in person or all presenters on Zoom), but I realize a lot can change throughout this semester, and we’ll adjust accordingly.\n\nAll work is expected to be submitted by the deadline and there are no make ups for any missed assessments. See the late work policy for more details.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nCollaboration: Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must also be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to lab questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nThe reading quizzes must be completed individually with absolutely no communication with classmates.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\nYou are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, please ask a member of the teaching team.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all Duke policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. Any questions and/or concerns regarding academic integrity can be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards at conduct@duke.edu.\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will\n\nautomatically result in a 0 for the assignment,\ncan further impact your overall course grade, and\nwill be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\nPolicy on late work depends on the particular course component:\n\nReading quizzes: Late quizzes are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed quizzes.\nHomework assignments: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, send a DM on Slack to the Head TA to reopen your repository.\n\nLate, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points\nLate, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points\nMore than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback\n\nProjects: The following three components contribute to your project score.\n\nPresentation: Late presentations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations.\nWrite up: GitHub repositories will be closed to contributions at the deadline. If you need to submit your work late, Slack/email me to reopen your repository.\n\nLate, within 24 hours of deadline: -10% of available points\nLate, within 24-48 hours of deadline: -20% of available points\nMore than 48 hours later: No credit, and we will not provide written feedback\n\nPeer evaluation: Late peer evaluations are not accepted and there are no make ups for missed presentations. If you do not turn in your peer evaluation, you get 0 points for your own peer score as well, regardless of how your teammates have evaluated you.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email or DM the Head TA before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let me know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up and submitted via email to the course Head TA. These will be considered if points were tallied incorrectly or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after the second project presentations. Note that during the regrade process your score could go up or go down or not change.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to to review the lecture material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your homework assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\nNote that attendance and participation is part of your grade as well.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nIf you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board.",

Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and disability accommodations cannot be provided until a Faculty Accommodation Letter has been given to me. Please contact SDAO for more information: sdao@duke.edu or access.duke.edu.\n\n\nReligious accommodations\nStudents are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\nNote: If you’ve read this far in the syllabus, post a picture of your pet and their name if you have one or your favorite meme to the #random channel on Slack!",

    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA brief description of your dataset including its provenance (not simply TidyTuesday, but where they got the dataset from), dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nThe reason why you chose this dataset.\nThe two questions you want to answer.\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n\n\nPeer review\n\nReviewer tasks\nEach team will review the proposals of two other teams. The peer review will be completed during the lab session on Wednesday, February 7. On that day teams will have access to the project repos of the two teams whose work they’re reviewing. Reviews should start by cloning the team’s repo, re-rendering it locally to make sure you can reproduce their work, and then adding an issue to their repo with your peer review feedback.\nThe reviewer / reviewee assignments will be posted below:\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project proposal you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their proposals. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour write-up should consist of three parts:\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms. Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no prior knowledge of the dataset.\nQuestion 1: The title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nIntroduction (1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nApproach (1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nAnalysis (2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.\nDiscussion (1-3 paragraphs): In the Discussion section, interpret the results of your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\n\nQuestion 2: Same structure outlined for Question 1, but for your new question. And the title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nWe encourage you to be concise. A paragraph should typically not be longer than 5 sentences.\nYou are not required to perform any statistical tests in this project, but you may do so if you find it helpful to answer your question.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time. Your presentation will be created using Quarto, which allows you to write slides using the same Quarto structure you’re used to. There is a sample Quarto slide template in your repo you can edit to your heart’s desire to create your presentation. Roughly I recommend 1 slide for introduction, 2 slides for Question 1, ans 2 slides for Question 2. You can imagine spending roughly one minute on each slide. You should feel free to have more (or fewer) slides. Your evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website that looks like https://vizdata-s24.github.io/project-1. You are not expected to change the styling of the website, but if you want to, you’ll need to edit the _quarto.yml file in your repo. Feel free to google your way around it or ask on the discussion forum / office hours!",

Here are a few ideas to help you get started thinking:\n\nPresent and visualize a technical topic in statistics or mathematics, e.g., Gradient descent, quadrature, autoregressive (AR) models, etc.\nBuild a Shiny app that that has an Instagram-like user interface for applying filters, except not filters but themes for ggplots.\nCreate an R package that provides functionality for a set of ggplot2 themes and/or color palettes.1\nBuild a generative art system.\nDo a deep dive into accessibility for data visualization and build a lesson plan for creating accessible visualizations with ggplot2, Quarto, and generally within the R ecosystem.\nCreate an interactive and/or animated spatio-temporal visualization on a topic of interest to you, e.g., redistricting, COVID-19, voter suppression, etc.\nRecreate art pieces with ggplot2.\nMake a data visualization telling a story and convert it to an illustration, presenting both the computational and artistic piece side by side.\nBuild a dashboard.\n\nAnd, of course, your project can be a about visualizing a dataset of interest to you (similar to your first project). The only rule about this dataset is that it can’t be from TidyTuesday. Beyond that, it should be something truly of interest to your team, and a dataset that allows for a deep exploration.\nMost importantly, be prepared to brainstorm a bunch of ideas and discard them until you settle on a topic that everyone in the team is happy with and feels like a good choice for showcasing what you’ve learned in the class and how you can use that to learn something new and implement for your project.",

    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nYour proposal should include:\n\nA one sentence description of your high-level goal (such as the ones listed under Ideas above.\nA one to two paragraph description of your goals, including your motivation. Depending on the focus of your project, the following might go in here.\n\nIf using particular dataset(s), a brief description of each dataset including the reason why you chose the particular dataset, its dataset, its dimensions and any other relevant metadata. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)\nIf answering a particular research question, the question itself and the reason why you chose this question.\n\nA weekly “plan of attack” outlining your steps to complete your project and including the team member(s) assigned to that task.\nThe final organization of your project repository. This means describing the project organization in your proposal as well as implementing that organization in your repo. Create any folders needed and place a README.md in each folder explaining what goes in there.\n\n\n\nPeer review\nThe peer reviews will be completed during the lab sessions as indicated above. On those days teams will have access to the project repos of the teams whose work they’re reviewing. The first peer review will be of proposals and the second peer review will be of code and organization.\n\nReviewer tasks\nTeams will develop the review together, with discussion among all team members, but only one team member will submit it as an issue on the project repo. To do so, go to the Issues tab, click on the green New issue button on the top right, and then click on the green Get started button for the issue template titled Proposal peer review or Code peer review.\nThis will start a new issue with a peer review form that you can fill out. Make sure to update the introductory paragraph with your team name and the names of the team members participating in the review. Then, answer each of the questions in the spaces provided underneath them. You’re expected to be thorough in your review, but this doesn’t necessarily require lengthy responses.\nRemember, your goal is to help the team whose project you’re reviewing. The team will not lose points because of issues you point out, as long as they address them before I review their work. You should be critical, but respectful in your review. Also remember that you will be evaluated on the quality of your review. So that’s an additional incentive to do a good job.\n\n\nReviewee tasks\nOnce you receive feedback from your peers, you should address them. You should do this by directly updating your proposal or making any other updates to your repo as needed. You can do these updates all in one commit or you can spread it across multiple commits. Regardless, in the last commit that addresses the peer review comments, you should use a keyword in your commit message that will close the peer review issues. These words are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, and resolved and they need to be followed by the issue number (which you can find next to the issue title). So, your commit message can say something like “Finished updates based on peer review, fixes #1”.\n\n\nPeer review assignments\nThe peer review assignments for proposal peer reviews are TO BE POSTED:\nThe peer review assignments for code peer reviews are TO BE POSTED:\n\n\n\nWrite-up\nYour have a lot more freedom in how you structure your write-up for this project compared to Project 1. This also comes with responsibility. You should make sure you have a clear introduction and a clear conclusion. You should also have other interim section headings that help the reader. Your write-up should be somewhere between 1000 and 2000 words. There is no expectation that you get close to the upper limit, anywhere in that range is fine as long as you have clearly explained yourself. The limits are provided to help you, not to set stressful expectations.\n\n\nPresentation\nYour presentation should generally follow the same structure as your write-up. Each team will have 5 minutes for their presentation, and each team member must speak (roughly equally) during this time.\nYou should create your presentation in a reproducible way, e.g., using Quarto. However you don’t have to use a package that is designed specifically for slides. If you prefer to build a dashboard or a Shiny app or a website, that’s fine too. The only rule is that it’s built reproducibly using R.\nYour evaluation will be based on your content, professionalism (including sticking to time), and your performance during the Q&A (question and answer). We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n\nWebsite\nEach of your projects will have a website. You can use the same workflow as for your first project or create something different. For example, if your project is building a dashboard, you might consider making your write-up a tab on that dashboard. Or if it’s building a package, you might consider making your website using the pkgdown package. Feel free to google your way around it or ask in lab sessions, on the discussion forum, or office hours!",

If you would like additional security you can encrypt this key using a passphrase (i.e. password) via credentials::ssh_update_passphrase() which will then be required each time the key pair is used (e.g. pushing, pulling, etc.).\nI get an error about an unprotected private key file when trying to use git\nIf you are seeing an error message that looks like the following:\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nPermissions 0644 for '/home/guest/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.\nIt is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.\nThis private key will be ignored.\nLoad key \"/home/guest/.ssh/id_rsa\": bad permissions\ngit@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\nthis is likely due to your system having a slightly outdated version of the credentials package which had a bug where the wrong permissions were applied to the key pair files. You can either fix the permissions to remove read access to anyone but yourself or update credentials, delete the existing keys, and start the process over. See Google for documentation on how to change permissions on your specific OS.\nI set this up for my container and now it won’t work on stat server (or some other computer)\nThis process, much like git configuration, must be done on each machine you intend to use, or at least each file system. Generally the recommendation is to create a new key pair for each machine you will be using, e.g. OIT container, stat server, your laptop, etc. The process is quick and GitHub supports the addition of multiple public keys.",
