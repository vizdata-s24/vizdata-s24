Use a short and informative label. For any exercise where you’re creating a plot, make sure to label all axes, legends, etc. and give it an informative title. For any exercise where you’re including a description and/or interpretation, use full sentences. Make a commit at least after finishing each exercise, or better yet, more frequently. Push your work regularly to GitHub. Once you’re done, inspect your GitHub repo to make sure you've pushed all of your changes.\n\n::: callout-note\nYour homework repositories are set up to run a GitHub action every time you push to the repository checking for (1) any files that shouldn't be in your repository or that should be in a specific folder in your repository and (2) whether your Quarto document renders.\n\n![](images/badge-fail.svg){fig-align=\"left\" style=\"float: left;\" width=\"122\" height=\"14\"}\n\nIf either of these checks fail, you'll see a red badge on your repository README and you'll get an email saying \"check assignment\" action has failed.\n\n![](images/badge-pass.svg){fig-align=\"left\" style=\"float: left;\" width=\"122\" height=\"14\"}\n\nIf they pass, you'll see a green badge on your repository README and you won't get an email saying.\n\nUp until the deadline, it doesn't matter how many times these checks fail. Just make sure by the end the badge is green.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Question 1\n\n**A new day, a new plot, a new geom.** The goal of this exercise is to learn about a new type of plot (ridgeline plot) and to learn how to make it.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis is not a geom we introduced in class, so seeing an example of it in action will be helpful. Read the package README at <https://wilkelab.org/ggridges> and/or the introduction vignette at <https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/articles/introduction.html>. There is more information than you need for this question in the vignette; the first section on Geoms should be sufficient to help you get started.\n:::\n\nUse the `geom_density_ridges()` function from the **ggridges** package to make a ridge plot of of Airbnb review scores of Edinburgh neighborhoods. The neighborhoods should be ordered by their median review scores. The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it’s called `edibnb`. Also include an interpretation for your visualization.\n\na\\. **Prep.** The data we will use for this exercise is `epa2021` from the **openintro** package. First, you're asked to prepare this data for plotting in a very specific way. Fill in the blanks below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepa2021_longer <- epa2021 |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ___, # must use a selection helper: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html#overview-of-selection-features \n    names_to = \"mpg_type\",\n    values_to = \"mpg_value\",\n    names_pattern = \"___\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    # reorder values of mpg_type to be in the order cty, hwy, comb\n    mpg_type = fct_relevel(___),\n    # recode levels of mpg_type to be City (instead of city), Highway (Hwy), Combined (comb)\n    mpg_type = fct_recode(___),\n    # reorder values of transmission based on median value of mpg_value\n    transmission = fct_reorder(___)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nb\\. **Visualize.** Recreate the following visualization using the `epa2021_longer` data frame you created in part (a). Some notes:\n\n-   This uses a colorblind-friendly color scale from ggthemes.\n\n-   The theme is `theme_bw()` but the background color of facet titles and the text color and font face for the them are modified. You don't have to match the exact shade of gray, but your code should be modifying these elements to look similar to the desired output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-2-draft_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\n**Another look at MPGs.**\n\na\\. Redo part (a) of Question 1 with an alternate pipeline. You should still use `pivot_longer()` but might use a different set of arguments. You will still likely do some additional data wrangling after, but can use a different set of argument and functions. Make sure your resulting data frame is the same as `epa2021_longer` you created above.\n\nb\\. Redo part (b) of Question 1, sort of. Use any other plot do visualize the distribution of MPGs for the three types recorded (city, highway, and combined) across transmissions. You can decide whether you want to use `transmission` or `transmission_desc`. Customize scales, geoms, etc. to your heart's desire.\n\nc\\. In a few sentences explain why you made the choices you made in part (b).\n\nd\\. Interpret the visualization you created in part (b) in context of the data, i.e., what does it say about MPGs and transmission types?\n\n## Question 3\n\n**Foreign Connected PACs.** Only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees. (Source: <https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2024>).\n\nIn this exercise you will work with data from contributions to US political parties from foreign-connected PACs. The data is stored in CSV files in the `data` directory of your repository/project. There are 11 files, each for an election cycle between 2000 and 2024. You can load all of the data at once using the code below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 2427 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): PAC Name (Affiliate), Country of Origin/Parent Company, Total, Dems...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of this exercise is to recreate yet another plot. But there is a nontrivial amount of data wrangling and tidying that needs to happen before you can do that. Below are the steps you should follow so that you can obtain the necessary interim objects we will be looking for as we review your work.\n\n-   First, clean the names of the variables in the dataset with a new function from the [**janitor**](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/) package: [`clean_names()`](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/reference/clean_names.html). Then clean and transform the data such that you have something like the following at the end.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n-   Then, pivot the data longer such that instead of `dems` and `repubs` columns you have a column called `party` with levels `Democrat` and `Republican` and another column called `amount` that contains the amount of contribution.\n\n-   Then, For each election cycle (`year`) calculate the total amount of contributions to Democrat and Republican parties from PACs with `country_of_origin` UK. The resulting summary table should have two rows for each year of data, one for Democrat and one for Republican contributions.\n\n-   Then, recreate the following visualization.\n\nTO DO: ADD IMAGE\n\n-   Finally, remake the same visualization, but for a different country. I recommend you choose a country with a substantial number of contributions to US politics. Interpret the new visualization that you make.\n\n## Question 4\n\n**Median housing prices in the US.** The inspiration and the data for this exercise comes from <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS>. The two datasets you’ll use are median_housing and recessions, both of which are in the data folder of your repository.\n\n-   Load the two datasets using `read_csv()`.\n\n-   Rename the variables as date and price.\n\n-   Create the following visualization.\n\nTO DO: ADD PLOT\n\n-   Identify recessions that happened during the time frame of the `median_housing` dataset. Do this by adding a new variable to recessions that takes the value TRUE if the recession happened during this time frame and FALSE if not.\n\n-   Now recreate the following visualization. The shaded areas are recessions that happened during the time frame of the `median_housing` dataset. Hint: The shaded areas are “behind” the line.\n\nTO DO: ADD PLOT\n\n-   Create a subset of the `median_housing` dataset for data from 2019 and 2020 early. Add two columns: `year` and `quarter`. `year` is the year of the `date` and `quarter` takes the values Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 based on `date`.\n\n-   Create the following visualization.\n\n## Question 5\n\n**Thank you.** Make a plot that says “Thank you” on it. Get creative! You can make it however you like, e.g., annotation, geoms, fake data, etc. There will be points assigned to creativity for this exercise. So just annotating the plot with the letters would earn fewer points than a more creative approach. Also, use as little as defaults as possible, in terms of color scales, themes, etc. The plots you make will be shared with our guest speakers as part of a “thank you” note. If you would like your name shown on the plots shared with them, you should add your name somewhere on the plot, e.g., the caption. If you don’t want your name shown, just leave it out and the plot will be shared anonymously. (There are no points attached to adding your name to them, you can choose to share with your name or anonymously.)\n",
