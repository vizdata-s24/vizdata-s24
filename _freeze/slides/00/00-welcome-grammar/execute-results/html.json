I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisers and deans are excellent resources.\n\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n# Assessments\n\n## Attendance + participation (5%)\n\n-   Required throughout the semester in lecture and lab\n\n-   Students who attend at least 80% of the lectures and participate regularly in lecture and/or other course venues (lab + Slack) will receive full credit for this portion of their grade\n\n-   Participation in labs as well as on Slack will also count towards this component\n\n## Reading quizzes (10%)\n\n-   Online, individual\n-   Cover reading that is due since the previous quiz and up to and including the deadline for the given quiz\n-   Due by 10 am ET (beginning of class) on the indicated day on the course schedule\n-   **Lowest dropped**\n\n## Homework assignments (45%)\n\n-   Submitted on GitHub, individual\n-   Some lab sessions allocated to working on homework / getting feedback from TAs\n-   Due by 5 pm ET on the indicated day on the course schedule\n-   **Lowest dropped**\n\n## Projects\n\n-   Submitted on GitHub, team-based\n-   Interim deadlines, peer review on content, peer evaluation for team contribution\n-   Some lab sessions allocated to working on projects, doing peer review, getting feedback from TAs\n\n## Teams\n\n-   Team assignments\n    -   In class exercises and projects\n    -   Assigned different teams for each project\n    -   Peer evaluation during teamwork and after completion\n-   Expectations and roles\n    -   Everyone is expected to contribute equal *effort*\n    -   Everyone is expected to understand *all* code turned in\n    -   Individual contribution evaluated by peer evaluation, commits, etc.\n\n## Project 1 (15%)\n\n-   Same/similar data, different results\n\n-   Presentation and write-up\n\n-   Wrapped up before midterms grades are due\n\n## Project 2 (25%)\n\n-   The world is your oyster!

You may not directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy\n\n-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s)\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n## Use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) {.smaller}\n\n-   Treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources.\n\n-   Guiding principles:\n\n    -   \\(1\\) *Cognitive dimension:* Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\n\n    -   \\(2\\) *Ethical dimension***:** Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n-   **✅ AI tools for code:** You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. See the syllabus for guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n\n-   **❌ AI tools for narrative:** Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you.\n\n## Academic integrity\n\n> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n\n> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\n> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\n> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n## \n\n<br><br><br>\n\n::: {.large .hand style=\"text-align: center\"}\nmost importantly:\n\nask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!\n:::\n\n## \n\n# Support\n\n## Office hours {.smaller}\n\n-   Mine:\n\n    -   Tuesdays 2:30 - 3:30 pm - Old Chem 213 (+ Zoom upon request)\n\n        -   Any exceptions will be announced in class / course announcement\n\n-   TAs: TBA!\n\n-   Office hours start next Tuesday\n\n-   \\+ lots more resources listed on the syllabus!\n\n## Wellness\n\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\n-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.\n\n-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.\n\n# Course Tools\n\n## RStudio\n\n::: {.large style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n<https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers>\n:::\n\n-   Browser based RStudio instance(s) provided by Duke OIT\n\n-   Requires internet connection to access\n\n-   Provides consistency in hardware and software environments\n\n-   Local R installations are fine but we will not guarantee support\n\n## GitHub {.smaller}\n\n::: {.large style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n<https://github.com/vizdata-s24>\n:::\n\n-   GitHub organization for the course\n\n-   All of your work and your membership (enrollment) in the organization is private\n\n-   Each assignment is a private repo on GitHub, I distribute the assignments on GitHub and you submit them there\n\n-   Feedback on assignments is given as GitHub issues, scores recorded on Sakai Gradebook\n\n::: task\nFill out the *Getting to know you* survey for collection of your account names, later this week you will be invited to the course organization.\n:::\n\n## Username advice {.smaller}\n\n::: hand\nin case you don't yet have a GitHub account...\n:::\n\nSome brief advice about selecting your account names (particularly for GitHub),\n\n-   Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who they're dealing with and makes your username easier for people to guess or remember\n\n-   Reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack\n\n-   Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss\n\n-   Shorter is better than longer, but be as unique as possible\n\n-   Make it timeless. Avoid highlighting your current university, employer, or place of residence\n\n## Slack {.smaller}\n\n-   Online forum for asking and answering questions\n\n-   Private repo in the course organization\n\n-   You will need to join the course organization for access\n\n-   Ask **and answer** questions related to course logistics, assignment, etc. here\n\n-   Personal questions (e.g., extensions, illnesses, etc.) should be via email to me\n\n-   Once you join, browse the channels to make sure you're posting questions in the right channel, update your profile with your name, photo/avatar of you that matches your GitHub profile, and your pronouns\n\n-   **Unfortunately** Slack is **not** the best place to ask coding questions, but it's a great place for real-time connection and collaboration\n\n::: task\nDemo on Tuesday for asking good questions with proper code formatting.\n:::\n\n# Grammar of graphics\n\n## Data visualization\n\n> *\"The simple graph has
